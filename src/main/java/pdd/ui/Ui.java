/**
 * Handles all interaction with the user: printing the greeting/goodbye
 * messages, reading command lines from standard input, and printing the
 * responses to each command (task added/removed/listed, errors, etc).
 * Keeping all console I/O here means the rest of the program can work
 * with plain data and doesn't need to know how output is formatted.
 *
 * <p>Where each line goes is pluggable via {@code writer}: the console
 * text UI writes to {@link System#out}, while the JavaFX GUI ({@code
 * pdd.PDD#getResponse}) collects the same lines into a response string
 * instead, letting every {@code Command} keep calling the same
 * {@code showXxx} methods regardless of which UI is in front.
